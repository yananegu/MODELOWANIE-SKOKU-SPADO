# Parachute Jump Modeling

## Project Description
In our project, we simulated a parachute jump. Typically, parachute jump simulations involve using mathematical models and computer simulations to study the dynamics of a parachutist's jump. This kind of research can be used to better understand the aerodynamics of jumps, the impact of different body positions, and parachute designs. The results of these simulations can help professionals make better decisions and enhance the safety of parachutists.

## Objectives
- Derive the differential equation describing the jump.
- Solve this equation to obtain the velocity equation.
- Derive the equation for jump distance and analyze the results.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For performing the simulations.
- **Libraries**: math, numpy, sympy, scipy, scipy.integrate, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.optimize

- All results and analyses are presented in Polish.
